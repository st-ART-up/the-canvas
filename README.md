### Instructions:
Pixel Pusher has 2 parts to explore. To make art visit the canvas, and to view art visit the gallery.
#### Canvas:
##### terminal command: npx -p @st-art-up/pixel-pusher@latest canvas
Choose your favorite colors and click on the canvas with your mouse to draw.
Brush sizes and erasers are on the left, pick the size you need.
Add some fun text (a poem, perhaps?) on the canvas by using the bottom yellow input bar.
To start over click the clear button.

The optimal terminal size is 150x50

Mac users: To save, first click the login button to use your github account. Once you're logged in click the save button to take a screenshot. Next, click the upload button to send your art to the gallery.

Windows users: Sad story... you can draw in... Ubuntu, but the upload is not ready for version 1.0. Please screenshot your art with the PrtScn key to save and cherish forever.

#### Gallery:
##### terminal command: npx -p @st-art-up/pixel-pusher@latest gallery
Use the arrow keys to navigate the menu.

To browse the gallery select 'show me the art!':<br>
Select 'view all drawings' to see all the art saved by fellow pixel pushers. Select 'view image carousel' to see one random image! 

To view your own art work select 'log in and edit my drawings':<br>
After loging in you can select 'view my drawings' to revisit all your masterpieces. You can also delete a piece you no longer want in your gallery by selecting 'delete a drawing by its id'. Just enter the corresponding id of the art you want to trash, press enter, and it is gone forever.
